I describe financial services as the extinction phase, you either rapidly adapt or you go extinct. I expect the biggest impact on financial services will come from new entrants into the industry from non-financial services companies offering more convenient and targeted services across the ecosystem. For example, technology companies in e-commerce and media who are well-positioned to exploit opportunities from changes in regulation that enable new business models whilst leveraging their existing infrastructure. These new business models may include new distribution and risk assessment models enabled by technology and new funding models. This ultimately means a stronger value proposition to the customer enabling more customers to be served with a less capital intensive model.

On Wednesday, Finance Magnates learned that the former CEO has launched a new payments company called BridgerPay.</p> <p>The launch of the new company comes less than six months after Cohen announced that he had sold his stake in Traders Group, a company that focuses on trading education, to Axios Capital \u2013 a private equity firm.</p> <p>According to Cohen, the new solution acts as an artificial intelligence-powered payment and data management platform, which was designed to reduce processing costs and increase approval ratios.</p> <p>\u201cMost of [the] existing payments infrastructure [was] not built to handle the exponential growth, complexity and scalability of the current global payments arena,\u201d Cohen told Finance Magnates. \u201cBridgerPay is a single source of truth, allowing merchants to connect their data across providers and countries and to gain the right insights instantly.\u201d</p> <p><strong>BridgerPay already seeing success</strong><br> Cohen may have only launched BridgerPay in the past couple of months, but it is already enjoying some success.</p> <p>The company has, for instance, been picked up by KPMG\u2019s FinTech Start Up Program. According to Cohen, the consulting giant will guide BridgerPay through its upcoming fundraising rounds.</p> <p>On top of this, the company has formed more than 100 partnerships with payment service providers and payment solutions firms operating in the retail trading industry.</p> <p>Currently, the company has one office in that hub of retail trading activity \u2013 Limassol, Cyprus. That number is likely to grow, however, as formal representatives for the company are setting up shop in Canada, Israel, and Australia.</p> <p>Cohen\u2019s experience in the retail trading industry is likely to make that market his first port of call once BridgerPay is really up and running, but that doesn\u2019t mean the company\u2019s solution wouldn\u2019t be useful to almost any online merchant.</p> <p>\u201cOur intention is to create initial traction in the financial industry that we know well,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cThen we can continue\u2026to grow in the global online businesses market.\u201d</p> <p>BridgerPay will be launching later this month at the iFX Expo Asia. So, if you haven\u2019t already, get your ticket and head over to Hong Kong for what will be one of the most scintillating events in the retail trading industry this year.</p>"}]},iEoG:function(e,n,t){"use strict";var
